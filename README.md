# Svelte Lite
## An Opinionated, but Slim Template for Svelte

> The only thing needed is PNPM, that's it, don't even need to install Node :hushed:

### What's included?
- PNPM, so it can replace nvm, allow comments in package.json, faster downloads, etc.
- SCSS, so you don't have to use CSS lol
- TypeScript, so you don't have to use JavaScript lol
- Vite, so you can run svelte fast

### What's NOT included?
- Linter, so you can choose your own linter, i.e. - eslint, tslint, standard, etc.
- Unit Testing, so you can choose your own test runner, i.e. - jest, jasmine, native node test runner, etc.
- E2E Testing, so you can choose your own e2e test runner, i.e. - playwright, cypress, storybooks, etc.
